[alife-announce] post-doc: modelling evolutionary transitions in individuality

This project (funded by the John Templeton Foundation) investigates the evolutionary transitions in individuality, such as the transition from unicellular life to multicellular organisms. The approach will build on recent developments unifying evolutionary theory with learning theory (Watson & Szathmary, 2016, TREE, 31(2), 147-157). This work converts (connectionist) models of distributed learning and cognition, already well-developed in computer science/neural networks/machine learning, to deepen and expand our understanding of natural evolution. The candidate will use computational modelling to explore the evolution of network structure and its effect on ecological/developmental organisation and evolutionary capabilities. This will characterise the type of relationships and organisation that is needed to convert a collection of (previously) independent evolutionary individuals into a new level of organisation that functions and evolves at a new, higher level of individuality. In particular, we will explore the hypothesis that the conditions that enable evolution to exhibit a transition in individuality are predicted by the conditions that enable learning systems to induce and exploit deep models, a.k.a. deep learning.
